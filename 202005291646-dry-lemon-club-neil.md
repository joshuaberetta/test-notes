	- [A guide to collaborative leadership](https://www.ted.com/talks/lorna_davis_a_guide_to_collaborative_leadership) - Lorna Davis
		- one person on their own can't be the answer to everything
		- good leadership is a collaboration of many others and their influence on you
		- tranditional leader will deliver bite sized tasks 
			- will announce a goad once they know exactly how to get there a `hero`
			- dont want input from anyone else in case they lose control
		- collaborative / interdependant leader sets BHAGS
			- willing to set the goal before knowing the plan on how to get there
			- driven by passion
		- why do traditional heros still exist?
			- much harder to be collaborative - requires people willing to be vulnerable [[wisdom]]
	- [efficient leadership in the digital era](https://www.ted.com/talks/charlene_li_efficient_leadership_in_the_digital_era) - Charlene Li
		- we need to trust our people and not feel the need to micromanage
		- heirachies formed during WWI leadership and in the industrial revolution
		- **middle management the main problem**
		- need to create a culture of sharing
		- practice followership - the size and quality of your network determines you influence, not your title
	- [listen, learn then lead](https://www.ted.com/talks/stanley_mcchrystal_listen_learn_then_lead) - Stanley McChrystal
		- creating a shared sense of purpose despite generational differences - commiting to the same goal
			- adapting how you communicate to different groups of people
	- [why good leaders make you feel safe](https://www.ted.com/search?q=Why+good+leaders+make+you+feel+safe) - Simon Sinek
		- people respond in certain ways often because of fear: losing job, etc.
		- you wouldn't fire you children from your family
	- Start with the why
		- if you dont know why your customers are the, you likely wont know why your employees are there
		- example of founder of Walmart - so successful because of the reason why it was started

## Notes
- motivation:
	- incredible positive change when jobs
	- think about who we want to be and where we are right now
	- only really realise how bad things are when you leave and see how things can be different.
		- such a contrast between Robertson and Caine
			- poisonous culture that trickled down from the top
	- Rondebosch rowing
- management vs leadership
	- top level of management you are defining the goals for the team
		- planning, organinsing, staffing, **leading**, controlling
	- manangers hiring like-minded managers?
		- a recursive downward spiral
	- visionary [[steve-jobs]]
		- requires competant team to guide them with little guidance
	- people come first
		- important, but time-consuming - making people feel like they are part of a family
	- democratic
		- maintains levels of trust and group accountability
	- pacesetting
		- leading people by example - high energy and high engagement atmosphere and encouraging people to better themselves
- leadership's role in management
	- cant have management without leadership
	- getting the best out of individuals
	- the best management style is contextual and dependant on the people and circumstances
		- authoritative leading has its place, especially in times of crisis 
	- top down leadership pushes people to run out of steam - works well in mass production when people are treated as cogs in a machine, but not when the people actually matter

> all things in leadership rise and fall [[john-maxwell]]

- creating a following
	- requires confidence, but also competance - confidence can grow out of competance
	- the intravert who people admire and trust draws people to them
	- authenticity is something that people are drawn to

> fearce will and humilty

- Steve Jobs
	- goal to put a dent in the universe

## Discussion Qs
- why are some companies more successful with terrible leadership
- where do hero leaders typically exist in an org
	- likely middle management because of the pressure above them
- Band of Brothers good examples of leadership
- Is good leadership genetic
	- (liam) personality can prime the kind of leader you might become
- challenging to lead people who have different points of view on fundamental things
